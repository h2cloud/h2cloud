## Kick off S-H2

- [x] Improve configure read process
- [x] modify the way to access files
- [ ] add inter-communication mechanism
- [ ] Consider reconstruct kvmap to allow fast access to timestamp
- [x] Add auto mergenext
- [ ] Prepare to auto-fix folders that have not got a proper ../.
- [ ] Consider modify Fs.Put() So that existing file could be removed
- [x] Set up auto invocation of task CHECK-IN
- [x] Set up logging level
- [x] Multi-routine fs functions
- [x] Set default file name and extension
- [ ] user meta support
- [x] **DO NEVER USE UPPER CASE FOR FILE META!!!**
- [x] Take advantage of Parent-Node meta to implement shortcut remove
- [x] Implement MOVE
- [x] Test MOVE
- [x] Implement parallel Sync
- [x] Implement parallel Put
- [x] Check parallelbility of outapi/fd operators
- [x] Linux test
- [ ] Handle submission gap
- [ ] Pressure test
- [ ] Dynamic setting for ls interval
- [x] Configuration value validation
- [x] Optimize trashbox position cache
- [x] Check Concurrency safety
- [x] For format filesystem, consider put a global lock to ensure its uniqueness
- [ ] Ensure uniqueness for container creation
- [x] Add file information for list elements
- [ ] Copy necessary user-defined headers
- [ ] Setup a faster MvXParalleled()
- [x] Return meta in GET
- [x] Maintain live inspection console
- [ ] global lock for auto trashbox maintainance
- [-] Writeback in force exit
- [ ] Implement faster merging worker by co-routine
- [x] Implement gossip
- [ ] Introduce live node adding
- [x] Push gossiped merging task to queue
- [-] Check all the go-ed funcs to avoid fdPool mis-release

## Known Bugs
- [ ] InApi: use constant rootNode instead of filesystem one
- [x] kernel/distributedvc::Fd: resolving no-zero-patch conflict
- [ ] kernel/filesystem::Fs.MvX: Modifying the header ORIGINAL_NAME of the object
- [x] the trigger of merging after submission
- [ ] the background re-submission may lead to incosistence between fd-nodes in trash and fd-nodes in fdPool
